      "content": "**Stroke Rehabilitation**\n\nStroke rehabilitation focuses on neuroplasticity-driven recovery through intensive, task-specific practice.\n\n**Key Evidence-Based Approaches:**\n\n\u2022 High-intensity, repetitive task practice is essential\n\u2022 Earlier intervention generally leads to better outcomes\n\u2022 Constraint-induced movement therapy has strong evidence for UE recovery\n\u2022 Body weight supported treadmill training aids early gait recovery\n\n**Evidence Level:** Level I for most interventions\n\n**Recommended Outcome Measures:** Fugl-Meyer, Berg Balance Scale, 10-Meter Walk Test\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Generate a specific program for this condition?\n- Search for the latest research?\n- Go deeper on any of these interventions?",
