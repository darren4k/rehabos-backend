      "content": "Based on your question about \"lets talk about cardiac rehab...\", here's what I can tell you:\n\n**General Evidence-Based Principles:**\n\n1. **Assessment First**\n   - Thorough evaluation guides treatment\n   - Use standardized outcome measures\n   - Identify patient goals\n\n2. **Evidence-Based Interventions**\n   - Exercise is typically first-line treatment\n   - Dose matters: intensity, frequency, duration\n   - Patient education is essential\n\n3. **Individualized Approach**\n   - Consider comorbidities\n   - Adapt to patient preferences\n   - Monitor and progress appropriately\n\nWould you like me to provide more specific information? Try asking about:\n- A specific condition (e.g., \"stroke rehabilitation\")\n- A particular intervention (e.g., \"balance training\")\n- Outcome measures for a condition\n- Treatment precautions\n\nI can also generate a personalized rehabilitation program if you provide patient details.",
